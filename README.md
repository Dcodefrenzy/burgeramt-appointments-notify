# Anmeldung-appointments-notify

This is a simple tool that checks service.berlin.de for appointments at intervals of 3 minutes/180secs. Upon discovering an available appointment, it triggers an audible alert for people.

This tool was born out of the frustration of constantly monitoring BÃ¼rgeramt websites for elusive appointment openings. With it, you can now utilize your time more efficiently, whether

- it's settling into your new apartment,
- focusing on work,
- or diving into your studies.

It's crucial to clarify that this tool does not perform appointment bookings, nor does it attempt to outmaneuver others with less coding expertise to secure better appointments. Its sole purpose is to provide timely notifications when Anmeldung appointments become available on service.berlin.de.

# For Developers:

For developers, this tool is open source and can be easily installed on your computer..

# For Non-Developers:

We're planning to launch this tool as a Telegram bot or a website. By using it, you'll receive notifications whenever appointments become available. It's essential to note that this tool doesn't assist in securing appointments but rather allows you to make the most of your time while waiting for appointment dates.
